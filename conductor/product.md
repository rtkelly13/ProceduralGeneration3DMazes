# Initial Concept

A procedural maze generation system built with **Godot 4** and **C#**, designed as a comprehensive educational and benchmarking tool.

## Target Audience
- **Students/Educators:** To learn about and demonstrate maze generation and solving algorithms.

## Core Goals
- **Education:** To provide clear, interactive demonstrations of how algorithms traverse and carve mazes.
- **Benchmarking:** To compare performance and structural characteristics of different generation algorithms.

## Key Features
- **Educational Visualization:**
    - Real-time step-through (pause, play, single-step) of generation and solving processes.
    - Clear visualization of algorithm states (current cell, frontier, visited).
- **Advanced Benchmarking:**
    - Detailed algorithm metrics (dead-end count, branching factor, solution length).
    - Comparative analysis features to run algorithms side-by-side or in sequence.
    - AI Agent comparison (Random vs. Perfect solvers) to test maze difficulty and solvability.
- **High Configurability:**
    - Extensive options to configure algorithm parameters (weights, biases, seeds).
    - Capability to set up and run through diverse scenarios for rigorous testing.
- **Data & Reporting:**
    - **Visual Heatmaps:** To visualize path usage and algorithm behavior.
    - **Comparative Charts:** For in-app analysis of algorithm differences.
    - **Exportable Reports:** CSV/JSON output for debugging, importing/exporting layouts, feeding test suites, and external analysis.

## Usage Context
- Used as a standalone interactive tool for learning and experimentation.
- Acts as a generator and testbed for specific maze use-cases and AI agent training.
